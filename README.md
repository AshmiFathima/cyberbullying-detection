# cyberbullying-detection

Harassment  by  cyberbullies  is  a  significant  phenomenon  on  the  social  media  which  is  quite  disturbing  and troubling.  It  appears  in  various  forms  and  is  commonly  seen in  a  textual  format  in  most  social  networks.  
Intelligent  and advanced systems are necessary for automated detection of these incidents.  Existing  works  for  cyberbullying  detection  have  quite a few bottlenecks. 
They address just one topic of cyberbullying. Also  they  rely  on  the  use  of  swear  words.  We  show  that  deep learning  based  models  can  overcome  these  bottlenecks.

We plan to use publicly available datasets to efficiently train our models where each dataset addresses a different topic of cyberbullying. For example, Twitter dataset contains examples of racism. There are also datasets which contain examples of sexism. We  are  using  Deep  Neural  Network  (DNN)  Based  Models  like  BLSTM  for  training  our  model.
In order to capture the semantics and similarities between words, word embedding is used to model words. For the  sake  of  word  embedding,  Global  Vector (GloVe)  was  chosen  because it  has  outperformed  other  models  in  word  similarity  and  named  entity  recognition.   
The  users  who  post cyberbullying content will be reported to the helpline via mail.  The system also makes an analysis of the cyberbullying posts which are visible to the user.
